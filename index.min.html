Primus originally formed in 1984 with Claypool and guitarist Todd Huth, later joined by drummer Jay Lane, though the latter two departed the band at the end of 1988. Featuring LaLonde and Alexander, Primus recorded their debut Suck on This in 1989, followed by four studio albums: Frizzle Fry, Sailing the Seas of Cheese, Pork Soda, and Tales from the Punchbowl. Alexander left the band in 1996, replaced by Bryan "Brain" Mantia, and Primus went on to record the original theme song for the TV show South Park and two more albums, Brown Album and Antipop, before declaring a hiatus in 2000.</div></div></div><div class="fade modal bd-modal-sm1" role=dialog aria-hidden=true  tabindex=-1><div class="modal-dialog modal-sm"><div class=modal-content>In 2003, Claypool and LaLonde reunited with Alexander and released a DVD/EP, Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People, before touring sporadically through 2009. In 2010, Lane rejoined Primus, replacing Alexander, and the band released their seventh album, Green Naugahyde, in 2011. In 2013, Lane left the band to focus on other projects, and Tim Alexander rejoined once again. They have released some of their records on Claypool's own label Prawn Song Records. Primus is characterized by its irreverent, quirky approach to music. Robert Christgau once remarked: "[Primus is] quite possibly the strangest top-10 band ever, and good for them."</div></div></div><div class="text-center container" id=signup><div class=row><div class=col-sm-12><div class=well><p>Want to be kept up to date on all upcoming shows and events?

It was remastered in 2002, after the original had been out of print for years, and was released on Prawn Song Records. The remaster includes an extra track, named "Hello Skinny/Constantinople", a cover of the tracks "Hello Skinny" and "Constantinople" by The Residents.</div></div></div></div><div class="text-center container animation-element slide-right"><div class=row><div class=col-sm-4><img alt=Image src=photos/albums/STSOC.jpg class=img-responsive></div><div class=col-sm-8><div class=well><p>Sailing the Seas of Cheese is the second studio album and major-label debut by Primus, released on May 14, 1991. It spawned three singles: "Jerry Was a Race Car Driver", "Tommy the Cat", and "Those Damned Blue-Collar Tweekers". "Jerry Was a Race Car Driver" appeared in the video games ATV Offroad Fury, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Rock Band 3, and as downloadable content for Rocksmith 2014, while "American Life" appears in Tony Hawk's Project 8.</div></div></div></div><div class="text-center container animation-element slide-left"><div class=row><div class=col-sm-4><img alt=Image src=photos/albums/porkSoda.jpg class=img-responsive></div><div class=col-sm-8><div class=well><p>Pork Soda is the third studio album by the American rock band Primus, released April 20, 1993, certified Gold in September 1993 and certified Platinum in May 1997. The album comes in a digipak and contains a booklet with lyrics printed to nine songs, omitting "Pork Soda" which consists of a series of unintelligible rants. This is also the first of three Primus releases to feature explicit lyrics printed for any of their songs. Pop culture references abound on the album, including Hank Williams Jr., Cher, Pink Floyd, the Residents, Jerry Garcia, Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, Macbeth, Costco, Dr. Martens, Bottom and Ren & Stimpy.</div></div></div></div><div class="text-center container animation-element slide-right"><div class=row><div class=col-sm-4><img alt=Image src=photos/albums/talesFromThePB.jpg class=img-responsive></div><div class=col-sm-8><div class=well><p>Tales from the Punchbowl is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Primus, released on June 6, 1995. It was the band's last album with Tim Alexander before he rejoined Primus seven years later, and again in September 2013. Punchbowl was certified Gold on July 20, 1995. In 1996 the album was re-released as an Enhanced CD for Macintosh and Windows. As printed on the back inlay for this version, "Combining high end production values, 3-D graphics, spectacular effects and loads of insanely cool stuff, the 'Tales From The Punchbowl' Enhanced CD, played on a CD-ROM drive, sends the viewer through a surreal virtual experience that features the complete album in CD sound quality (which you can hear on a stereo CD player as well)." Players must "navigate from the helm of Captain Shiner's ferryboat through an enchanted liquid atmosphere to many strange and mysterious islands. Many experiences are to be had, all in a rose-colored waterworld filled with visuals reminiscent of Dalí and Bosch." Printed on the actual CD is a ship helm instead of the large image of Captain Shiner's face that appeared on the original, more common pressing.</div></div></div></div><div class="text-center container animation-element slide-left"><div class=row><div class=col-sm-4><img alt=Image src=photos/albums/brownAlbum.jpg class=img-responsive></div><div class=col-sm-8><div class=well><p>Brown Album is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Primus. It was released on July 8, 1997. It was the first Primus release to not feature drummer Tim Alexander and the first to feature Bryan "Brain" Mantia. Claypool stated "Herb's departure was like a marriage that just slowly decayed to an end." "When it came down to it, we came very close to dissolving entirely, to ending Primus. I went to Ler and said, 'Look, I'm not content anymore. We've got a good thing going between us and we should probably get a new drummer.' When we talked to Herb about it, he wasn't surprised at all--in fact he seemed very relieved. He's got his own thing now. He's writing and singing (with his new band, Laundry) and he's much happier." Regarding the name of the album, Claypool said "This is a milestone record for Primus so it needed to have a milestone title. The Beatles have their 'White Album,' Metallica have their 'Black Album,' now Primus have their 'Brown Album.'"</div></div></div></div><div class="text-center container animation-element slide-right"><div class=row><div class=col-sm-4><img alt=Image src=photos/albums/antipop.jpg class=img-responsive></div><div class=col-sm-8><div class=well><p>Antipop is the sixth studio album by the American rock band Primus, released on October 19, 1999. It was the band's final release before their hiatus in 2000-2003. It was also the last album with drummer Bryan Mantia. The album features several well-known guest musicians and producers, including Tom Waits, James Hetfield (of Metallica), Jim Martin (former member of Faith No More), Fred Durst (of Limp Bizkit) and Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine). Regarding the album's production, Claypool has stated "Antipop was the most difficult record we ever made, because there was a lot of tension between the three of us, and there was some doubt at the label as to whether we knew what the hell we were doing anymore.</div></div></div></div><div class="text-center container animation-element slide-left"><div class=row><div class=col-sm-4><img alt=Image src=photos/albums/greenNaug.jpg class=img-responsive></div><div class=col-sm-8><div class=well><p>Green Naugahyde is the seventh studio album by rock group Primus, released by ATO Records and Prawn Song on September 12, 2011 in Europe, and on September 13, 2011 in the United States. It is the band's first album since 1999's Antipop, and features their first new material since 2003's Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People EP. It is the only Primus album to feature Jay Lane on drums, as he left the band in September 2013.The album's title comes from the lyrics to the song "Lee Van Cleef", which describe a group of friends watching movies featuring Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and driving a yellow Studebaker with a green Naugahyde interior.</div></div></div></div><div class="text-center container animation-element slide-right"><div class=row><div class=col-sm-4><img alt=Image src=photos/albums/primusChocolateFactory.jpg class=img-responsive></div><div class=col-sm-8><div class=well><p>Primus & the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble is the eighth studio album by American rock group Primus. The album is a re-imagining of the soundtrack of the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. The album was released on October 21, 2014. It is the first full-length album with Tim "Herb" Alexander since 1995's Tales from the Punchbowl.Lead singer and bassist Les Claypool told Rolling Stone of his fascination with Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, the 1971 film adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: "I don't think it was until Jaws came along that I was more obsessed with a film, when I started drawing sharks all over my binders and notebooks. Prior to that it was everything Wonka." This tribute — fleshed out with help from Critters Buggin percussionist Mike Dillon and Frog Brigade cellist Sam Bass — is a logical extension of Primus' Wonka-themed performance in Oakland last New Year's Eve.During an interview at The Greene Space, Les Claypool explained that one idea for his next record was a cover of The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour. Although this project never came to fruition, he stated that he was glad it didn't work out since he later found out that The Flaming Lips were producing their cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band around the same time.</div></div></div></div></div><footer class="text-center container-fluid"><a href=#top>BACK TO TOP</a><p>Trevor Booth Development</footer><script src=script.js></script>
